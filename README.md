# Android Topics Classifier Demo

This repository contains the source code for the Android Topics API Classifier Execution Demo, a Google Colab project you can use to test what topics results are returned from the Android Topics Classifier with different types of app information. 

The Topics Classifier only uses the package name to determine the topics that are returned, and may not necessarily be in line with the categories youâ€™d assign to your app from the taxonomy. Note:This toolkit is under active development, and [feedback is encouraged.](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=1116743&template=1636967) [Get started with the Topics Classifier colab](https://githubtocolab.com/privacysandbox/android-topics-classifier).
